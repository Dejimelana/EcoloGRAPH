You are extracting key entities from a scientific research paper.

PAPER METADATA:
Title: {title}
Authors: {authors}
Year: {year}

TASK:
Extract ALL key entities, methods, measurements, and locations from the paper chunks below. These chunks are sequential sections from the same paper.

IMPORTANT:
1. Be domain-agnostic: Extract entities regardless of scientific field (AI, engineering, remote sensing, etc.)
2. Focus on concrete entities: organisms, materials, devices, locations, algorithms, datasets
3. Include measurements and parameters with their values
4. Preserve exact terminology from the paper

NOTES:
- "key_entities" captures anything important: algorithms, devices, materials, software, etc.
- "species" included for compatibility, but can be empty if none mentioned
- "measurements" includes any quantitative values: accuracy, speed, size, temperature, etc.
- If a field doesn't apply, use empty array []

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
