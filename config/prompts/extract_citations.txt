You are extracting bibliographic citations from a paper's References section.

Extract ALL citations and return them as a JSON array. For each citation, extract:
- authors: list of author names (last name, first initial format if possible)
- title: exact paper title
- year: publication year as integer
- journal: journal or venue name  
- doi: DOI if present (null if not)

REFERENCES SECTION:
{references_text}

Return as JSON array:

[
  {{
    "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Doe, A."],
    "title": "Marine fish biodiversity trends in the North Atlantic",
    "year": 2023,
    "journal": "Nature Ecology & Evolution",
    "doi": "10.1038/s41559-023-12345"
  }},
  {{
    "authors": ["Johnson, B.", "Williams, C."],
    "title": "Climate change impacts on coastal fisheries",
    "year": 2022,
    "journal": "Science",
    "doi": null
  }}
]

IMPORTANT:
- Extract authors and title EXACTLY as written
- Year must be an integer (not string)
- If DOI not present, use null (not empty string)
- Skip incomplete or malformed citations
- Ignore non-paper citations (books, reports, websites) unless they have a DOI

Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text.
